1. Project Title:
Smart Shuttle Tracker App for Real-Time Bus Location

2. Your Name & Roll Number:
Nanduri Sai Sundara Gourav – 2024-B-03072007

3. Problem Statement:
"Students and staff often face uncertainty about shuttle arrival times, leading to wasted time and overcrowding at stops. This project aims to provide real-time location tracking for campus shuttle services, helping users plan their commute more efficiently and reducing waiting times."

4. Proposed Solution / Idea:
"A React Native mobile application that integrates GPS tracking to display live shuttle locations, estimated arrival times, and route information. Users can check nearby stops, receive notifications when a shuttle is approaching, and view shuttle schedules — all in one app."

5. Key Features:

Real-time GPS-based shuttle location tracking on an interactive map

Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each stop

Live route and stop information for shuttles

Push notifications when a shuttle is near a selected stop

Search and filter shuttles based on routes or time

Offline access to shuttle schedules

6. Target Users / Audience:
"College students, staff, and campus visitors using shuttle services."

7. Technology Stack:

Frontend (Mobile App): React Native, Expo

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: Firebase / MongoDB

Maps & Location Services: Google Maps API, GPS tracking SDK

Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

8. Expected Outcome:
"A fully functional mobile application that allows users to track campus shuttles in real time, view ETAs, and receive timely notifications, ensuring a more efficient and stress-free commute."

9. Timeline:

Week 1–2: Research, UI/UX design, and API selection

Week 3–4: Backend setup, GPS integration, and database design

Week 5–6: Frontend development with live tracking and ETA features

Week 7: Push notification integration and testing

Week 8: Deployment and feedback collection

10. Additional Notes:

Requires GPS-enabled devices on each shuttle for accurate tracking

Google Maps API costs need to be considered for scaling

Could be extended in the future to include ticket booking or seat availability
